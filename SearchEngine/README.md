This is a search engine project that first parses through a .json file of provided supreme court documents and puts stemmed (using porter2Stemmer library) non-stop words and their corresponding document number into an AVLTree (self-sorting binary tree) and then is user searchable. It also has different modes such as the ability to add more files to search through or the ability to remove files to search through. Additionally, when searching it pulls up the top 15 and uses the corresponding frequency to rank the results.
